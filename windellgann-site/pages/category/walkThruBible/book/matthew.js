  Introduction<p>


  

 <b> AUTHOR:</b>  Matthew was a tax-collector in the service of the

Roman occupying force and was called by Jesus to 'Follow me' and 

became one of the Twelve Apostles (Matt. 9:9-13; 10:3; Mark 2:14-17;

Luke 5:27-32).</p><p>


  It is said that when Matthew got up from that table to follow

Jesus he didn't leave his pen behind.  About twenty or thirty years

after Jesus went back to heaven the Holy Spirit inspired him to

write what we have today as "The Gospel of Matthew."</p><p>


  

<b>  BACKGROUND:</b>  Each Gospel has its own emphasis.  The term

"Kingdom of Heaven" occurs with such frequency in Matthew that

often it is called "The Gospel of the Kingdom."  </p><p>


  The Gospel of Matthew was written primarily for Jewish

readers.  The theme is "The King and His Kingdom."  One key word

in the book is "fulfilled" for Matthew focuses on how Jesus fulfills

the promises of a Redeemer made by inspired writer in the Old

Testament. (The word is used about 17 times.)</p><p>

  Nowhere in the four Gospels do we find a single word that

Matthew spoke.  Yet in his Gospel he gives us the words and works

of Jesus Christ, "the Son of David, the Son of Abraham" (1:1)<p>

<b>DESIGN:</b>  The book was written to help the Jews understand Jesus

as King and to establish his spiritual rule over a spiritual kingdom. 

In Matthew Jesus' Kingship is alluded to some 10 times: 1:6; 2:2;

5:35; 21:5; 25:34; 25:40; 27:29; 27:37; 27:42.  The word "kingdom"

is found 54 times.</p><p>




  Matthew talks about the Kingdom of Heaven while Mark and

Luke describes it as the Kingdom of God.  This indicates the

kingdom is:<br/>


  </p><ul> <li> Divine-- its origin is of God above and not man below

    </li><li>Spiritual-- in nature, and not earthly and sensual

    </li><li>Universal-- not a kingdom confined to Palestine, etc.

    </li><li>Not National--  not racial, but a kingdom of faith

</li></ul>


  Matthew described Jesus as the Doer and the Teacher. None of

the four Gospels is a biography in the modern sense of the word.  In

fact, John doubted that a complete biography of Jesus could ever be

written (John 21:25).  There are many details about the earthly life

of Jesus that are not given in any of the Gospels.<p>




  Matthew does not try to give us a chronological outline of the

events in Jesus's life.  Rather, he tends to organize and group

similar incidents of "doings" and "teachings" together into ten

alternating sections.  He records more than 20 specific miracles and

6 major messages.  Over 60% of his book focuses on the teachings

of Jesus.</p><p>




  Matthew points that when he wrote his Gospel God's Kingdom

was what the people in the first century was calling the "church"

(16:18; 18:17).  The Greek word translated church means "a called-

out assembly." In the NT this word refers to a local assembly of

obedient believers.  In the OT, Israel was God's called-out people,

beginning with the call of Abraham (Gen. 12:1f; Deut 7:6-8).  In

fact, Stephen called the nation of Israel "the church (assembly) in

the wilderness" (Acts 7:38), for they were God's called-out people.

  But the NT church is a different people, for it is composed of

both Jews and Gentiles (Gal. 3:28).  Even though Matthew wrote

primarily for the Jews, he has a "universal" element in his book that

includes the Gentiles. For example, Gentile leaders came to worship

the infant Jesus (2:1-12); Jesus performed miracles for Gentiles and

even commended them for their faith (8:5-13; 15:21-28). At at crisis

hour in Jesus' ministry He turned to a prophecy about the Gentiles

(12:14-21).  Even in parables, Jesus indicated that the blessings

which Israel refused would be shared with the Gentiles (22:8-10;

21:40-46) and the Lord's commission involves all nations (28:19-20).</p><p>

2.  <b> A King's Position</b> -- "Out of Judah shall come a Governor that

  shall rule my people, Israel."  Matt. 2:6.  He is over his kingdom,

  the church ( Matt. 16:18; and see Ephesians 1:22).</p><p>


3.  <b> A King's Announcement</b> -- "Prepare ye the way of the Lord;

  make his paths straight,"  Matt. 3:3.  His coming conformed to a

5.  <b> A King's Authority</b> -- "He taught them as one having authority,"

  Matt. 7:29; ( Matt. 28:18-20 ).  The King's authority was absolute--

  answerable only to God.</p><p>


6.   <b>A King's Loyalty</b> -- "He that is not with me is against me, and he

  that gathereth not with me, scattereth abroad," Matt. 12:30. He

  has a demand for our loyalty.</p><p>


7.  <b> A King's Enemies</b> -- "From that time forth began Jesus to show

  unto his disciples how that he must go unto Jerusalem and

  suffer many things of the elders and chief priests and

11. <b> A King's Glory</b> -- "When the son of man shall come... the king

  shall say... come ye blessed of my father, inherit the

  kingdom,"   25:31-34. "...and then shall he sit upon the

  throne of this glory"  25:31.  A King's glory came on his

  coronation in Heaven upon his victory and conquest.<b></b></p><p><b>

Intro.<br/>


1.   In Matthew 5:38-45 Jesus teaches us how a Christian's conduct

should distinguish him from people of the world. </p><p>

 

2.   It is a part of the "Sermon on the Mount" and begins with the

word "blessed."  There is no question about the kind of life Jesus

came to impart.  The Master Teacher provides a recipe for

happiness.  It is not a "short-cut" but a "sure-cut" to happiness.</p><p>


<font size="+1"><b>  I. TURN THE OTHER CHEEK  (5:39</b></font>)</p><p>


1.   "But I say to you, do not resist him who is evil; but whoever

slaps you and your right cheek, turn to him the other also,"

(5:39).  </p><p>


. .   a. Jesus is not teaching pacifism; he's not talking about war,

self-defense, or the necessity of protecting our nation, our

homes, or even our lives.<br/>


. .   b. He is stating a great principle Do not try to get even; do not

seek revenge.<br/>


2.   Jesus' life was an example of this behavior.</p><p>


. .  a. Many times he was insulted, but never lashed back. <br/>


. .  b. Isaiah 53:7.<br/></p><p>




3.   Illustration of the famous surgeon and the artist.</p><p>
